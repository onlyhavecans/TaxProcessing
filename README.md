#Paper Tax Processing

This program does the heavy lifting and processes the incoming tax roll to be formatted for printing. It's a fairly easy process with some small gotcha's.

This won't be really useful to most anyone but it's VERY important because hand processing 150Meg of text by hand isn't possible and this is a tight deadline process. This is the backup of a backup of a backup... To be fair this could probably be done with one really nice awk but I think this format is way more documented and easy to maintain than some cryptic string
